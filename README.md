# GP3-MICE
Repository for the MICE PHPMyAdmin project for CSDE

So now we are using gitkraken (https://www.gitkraken.com/)

General advice to prevent things breaking: 
1) Make sure before doing any work on the project files locally, you use the gitkraken desktop client to pull any changes from the github    repo
2) IMPORTANT: Ensure that EasyPHP is closed before commiting any changes through gitkraken, we suspect that this causes issues if not        done.
3) Commit your changes locally and before pushing them so everyone recieves, just open EasyPHP again and check that its fully functional
3) Try and use descriptive commit comments so others know what you have changed.
